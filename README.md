# HELLO RUST

My first adventure into Rust. Cargo seems nice lol.

```sh
cargo run # run your app
cargo build # build your app and save it in $(pwd)/target/debug/**
cargo build --release # build your app with optimisations for prod and saves in $(pwd)/target/release/**
cargo check # just check to see if you haven't done something bad lol much faster than cargo build
# because it doesn't produce an executable
```
